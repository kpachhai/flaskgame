- **Limitation**: This prevents personalized gameplay and might expose sensitive game data.

### 4. **Game Mechanics**:

- **Issue**: The game mechanics are relatively simple and might not engage users for extended periods.
- **Limitation**: Limited replay value and user engagement.

### 5. **Frontend**:
